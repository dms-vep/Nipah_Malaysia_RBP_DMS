Using pseudocount 0.5
Requiring at least 16736.358 total wildtype counts for pre_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 16736358 total counts.

Adequate pre_count wildtype counts of 1744043

Requiring at least 27594.854 total wildtype counts for post_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 27594854 total counts.

Adequate post_count wildtype counts of 2631767
