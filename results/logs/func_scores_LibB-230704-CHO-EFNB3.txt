Using pseudocount 0.5
Requiring at least 6669.455 total wildtype counts for pre_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 6669455 total counts.

Adequate pre_count wildtype counts of 636339

Requiring at least 10469.348 total wildtype counts for post_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 10469348 total counts.

Adequate post_count wildtype counts of 1692583
