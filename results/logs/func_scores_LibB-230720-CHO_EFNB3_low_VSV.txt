These samples are for library='LibB'

Getting pre_selection_sample barcode counts from results/barcode_counts/LibB-230720-C6-low_cycles_VSV_counts.csv

Getting post_selection_sample barcode counts from results/barcode_counts/LibB-230720-no_antibody_counts.csv

Using pseudocount 0.5
Requiring at least 1000 total wildtype counts for pre_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 879435 total counts.

Adequate pre_count wildtype counts of 100782

Requiring at least 26289.138 total wildtype counts for post_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 26289138 total counts.

Adequate post_count wildtype counts of 4216838

Only keeping scores for variants with at least 30 pre-selection counts:
