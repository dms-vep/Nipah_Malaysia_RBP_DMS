Using pseudocount 0.5
Requiring at least 9068.982 total wildtype counts for pre_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 9068982 total counts.

Adequate pre_count wildtype counts of 1042519

Requiring at least 10681.892 total wildtype counts for post_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 10681892 total counts.

Adequate post_count wildtype counts of 1769864
