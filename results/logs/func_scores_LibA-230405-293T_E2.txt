Getting pre_selection_sample barcode counts from results/barcode_counts/LibA-230405-293T-E2-VSV_counts.csv

Getting post_selection_sample barcode counts from results/barcode_counts/LibA-230405-293T-E2-no_antibody_counts.csv

Using pseudocount 0.5
Requiring at least 55767.259 total wildtype counts for pre_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 55767259 total counts.

Adequate pre_count wildtype counts of 5627170

Requiring at least 65984.333 total wildtype counts for post_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 65984333 total counts.

Adequate post_count wildtype counts of 9546859
