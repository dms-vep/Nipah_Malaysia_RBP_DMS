Using pseudocount 0.5
Requiring at least 19859.214 total wildtype counts for pre_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 19859214 total counts.

Adequate pre_count wildtype counts of 1889360

Requiring at least 29413.23 total wildtype counts for post_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 29413230 total counts.

Adequate post_count wildtype counts of 4390234
