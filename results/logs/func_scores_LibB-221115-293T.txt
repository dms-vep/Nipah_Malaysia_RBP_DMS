Using pseudocount 0.5
Requiring at least 26947.03 total wildtype counts for pre_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 26947030 total counts.

Adequate pre_count wildtype counts of 2697564

Requiring at least 53386.046 total wildtype counts for post_count, which is the greater of min_wt_count=1000 and min_wt_frac=0.001 of the 53386046 total counts.

Adequate post_count wildtype counts of 7340256
