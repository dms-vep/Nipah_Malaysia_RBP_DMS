### About

This website contains links and information for the Nipah virus receptor binding protein deep mutational scanning project. Look through jupyter notebooks used in analyses, or explore interactive charts. To view more information, click on GitHub logo in upper right. Interactive charts made with [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io){target="_self"}. Embedding of Altair plots was done by custom javascript code from [dms-vep](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep.github.io){target="_self"}. All work done in [Bloom Lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/bloom/en.html){target="_self"}, part of [Fred Hutch Cancer Center](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html){target="_self"}.

All experiments were performed with non-replicative HIV-based pseudoviruses. Ephrin-B2 and Ephrin-B3 orthologs from *Pteropus alecto* were used for cell entry and receptor binding assays.
